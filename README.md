**Digital Health in Germany**

Germany as a country, is a market that looked attractive from the outside for digital health startups worldwide. Yet there are hundreds of examples of digital
health innovators from Germany and companies from outside that either moved out again or failed all together, due to certain barriers that seem
to strongly impede the process of digitization process in healthcare. However, with the new regulations passed on November 7th 2019, by the German House of
Parliament, there will be a major impact on the success rate of digital health solutions provided to residents insured in Germany and HCPs.

This is in line with the Germany trade and invest, (2022) analysis, which reported that since 2018, the German Ministry of Health has pushed forward series of 
legislative
actions to digitize the health care system. In 2019, the German parliament passed the Digital Care Act (DVG) to accelerate digitization and innovation within
the German health care market. The act also paves the way to broad usage and reimbursement of digital health applications – so-called “DIGAs.” These steps open
up the German health care market to a digital transformation that will provide 73 million insured Germans access to digital health application on prescription.
The healthcare industry in Germany is undergoing massive digitization. By 2025, the German digital-health market is projected to be worth 57 Billion Euros.
