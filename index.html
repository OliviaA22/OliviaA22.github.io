        <h1>Opportunities in Digital Health in Germany: The Investors Perspective </h1>
        <h2>Analogue health care is wiped out</h2>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align:left">
        <p>Are you an investor, or you have interest in a digitalized society, are you very much attracted to Artificial
            Intelligence (AI) and the likes of it? Are you a young health practitioner who is fascinated and overwhelmed
            with all the happenings around the digitization of health care?</p>
        <p>Here is an eye-opener to things you need to know about Digital Health and by the end of this article, you
            will be so willing to financially, physically, or intellectually invest in digital health. Digital health
            currently has a very wide market for investors to make some revenue and have a taste of the “new oil”.</p>
        <h2>What do we mean by Analogue Healthcare?</h2>
        <p>Analogue Healthcare simply means the healthcare system whereby information travel via paper transfer, snail
            mail and fax, which is inefficient, disjointed and increases the time, effort, and cost spent on receiving
            and delivering healthcare. When patient information is not connected and is not available to key actors
            involved in the provision of healthcare, the result is disjointed, incomplete patient records. This, in
            turn, can lead to misdiagnosis, medical errors, waste, poor-quality care and, increasingly, insurance
            providers that deny payment for care that cannot be justified.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Unfortunately, we still live in a world where many patients’ experiences with their healthcare system is
            bogged down by analogue healthcare system.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Digital health, or digital healthcare, is a broad, multidisciplinary concept with an intersection between
            technology and healthcare. Digital health applies digital transformation to the healthcare field;
            incorporating software, hardware and services. When we speak about digital health, we are talking about
            mobile health (mHealth) apps, electronic health records (EHRs), electronic medical records (EMRs), wearable
            devices, telehealth and telemedicine, as well as personalized medicine.</p>
        <p>Terms related to digital health include health information technology (health IT), healthcare tools, health
            analytics, healthcare informatics, hospital IT and medical technology.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Digital Healthcare</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve health care quality or effectiveness</li>
            <li>Increase health care productivity or efficiency</li>
            <li>Prevent medical errors and increase health care accuracy and procedural correctness</li>
            <li>Reduce health care costs</li>
            <li> Increase administrative efficiencies and healthcare work processes</li>
            <li>Decrease paperwork and unproductive or idle work time</li>
            <li>Extend real-time communications of health informatics among health care professionals</li>
            <li>Expand access to affordable care</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>For instance, when we take a look at the difference between the digital Electronic Health Record (EHR), and
            the analogue paper-based health record as shown by the comparison below, will clearly show that EHR is much
            more productive and effective than the Paper based records in so many areas, including time; environment;
            security; cost; access; illegibility.</p>

        <h2>Challenges of Digital Health</h2>
        <p>Despite all, digital health is still affected by various challenges as shown in the image below</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Why should I Invest in Digital Health?</h2>
        <p>In order for efficiency and effectiveness to be achieved in the healthcare system, Digital health is required. As it increases access to
            health data and gives patients greater control over their health. Moreover, from statistics, digital health is forecasted to reach $379B
            by 2024.</p>

        <h2>Digital Health in Germany</h2>
        <p>Digital health is a growing area in healthcare with a huge potential, that it would be assumed that it is fully accepted and developed in
            the German healthcare system. However, the degree of digitalization in German healthcare is low when compared internationally and with
            other German industries.</p>
        <p>Germany as a country, is a market that looked attractive from the outside for digital health startups worldwide. Yet there are hundreds of
            examples of digital health innovators from Germany and companies from outside that either moved out again or failed all together. Despite
            political efforts, certain barriers seem to strongly impede the process of digitalization process in healthcare.
            Now, with the new regulations passed on November 7th 2019, by the German House of Parliament, there will be a major impact on the success
            rate of digital health solutions provided to residents insured in Germany and HCPs.

        </div>
        <h2>The Investors’ Opinion</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure expansion and interoperability would require a coordinated, state intervention. Positive communication on possibilities and
            benefits of digital solutions are also considered important. Moreover, with the number of digital health startups springing up, it could
            be deduced that investors are willing to invest in digital health.</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="digitalhealth startups.png" width="65%" height="62%">
            <br/>
            <h9>Source:
                <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/digital-health-startups-redefining-healthcare/">digital health startups</a></h9>
        </div>
        <p>From the Digital Health Summit held in Munich, Germany, it was brought to notice and attention the fact that many investors are willing to
            invest in digital health, However, due to the Germany system which does not support preventive measures, it is decreasing the pace at
            which healthcare digitization is being invested in. Nonetheless, it is recommended that if doctors begin to appreciate start-ups, and
            encourage the implementation of "DIGA", (which aims to open up the medical space by allowing Digital Health apps to be prescribed by
            doctors, just as they prescribe medications today), then the fate of digital health in Germany might positively be affected.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Despite the numerous challenges that seem to befall digital health in Germany, and the new ones to arise, the German healthcare market
            should be said to rank high on the geographical roadmap of international digital health providers. Market entry options are better than
            ever before, and this is an opportunity for investors to make a move towards digital health.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, it can be said that the investors are highly interested in investing into the digital health as it seems to be a very viable
            area.</p>

        <p>So, imagine a world in which a patient’s health information is available to all stakeholders, when and where needed. A patient can share
            personally collected information – blood pressure, glucose levels, weight, medication tolerance, and so on – that is received and
            understood by all key players in real time.
            Nonetheless, an overarching strategy, accompanied by a communication concept would likely be necessary or required for digital health to
            succeed. Digital health success is an all-round success for all the stakeholders involved - these include; patients, practitioners,
            researchers, application developers, and medical device manufacturers, investors, and distributors.
