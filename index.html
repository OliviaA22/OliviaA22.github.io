				<h2>What do we mean by Analogue Healthcare?</h2>
				<p>Analogue Healthcare simply means the healthcare system whereby information travel via paper transfer, snail mail and fax, which is inefficient, disjointed and increases the time, effort, and cost spent on receiving and delivering healthcare. When patient information is not connected and is not available to key actors involved in the provision of healthcare, the result is disjointed, incomplete patient records. This, in turn, can lead to misdiagnosis, medical errors, waste, poor-quality care and, increasingly, insurance providers that deny payment for care that cannot be justified.</p>
